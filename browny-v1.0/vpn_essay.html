										<strong style="font-size: 17px;">Introduction</strong> <br>
										This Document will contain information on what VPN is, how VPN (Virtual Private Network) 
										work, and the reasons we use a VPN, and A discusses why we need VPN or no VPN. We will talk
										 about different kinds of VPNs and how they are operated, we will implement how to set them up. 
										 <br> <br>
										 <strong style="font-size: 17px;">What is VPN and How does it work?</strong> <br><br>
										 VPN a Virtual Private Network is an arrangement by which a secure, apparently private network is achieved using encryption over an internet public network. (this definition is according to google dictionary), 
										 I think I just through you off with my definition so I will so clearly VPN is a service that protects your internet connection and gives you privacy online. 
										VPNs create an encrypted tunnel for your data and protect your online identity by hiding your IP address and allow you to use public Wi-Fi hotspots safely.
										Example: 
										on this example my car is my personal date, and the bus is the airport Wi-Fi hotspots, no vpn is visibility on the bus and vpn is invisibility.
										<br><br>
										<h3> No VPN on public Wi-Fi </h3><br>
										Ruhigita wants to go to Walmart but the fuel on his car is so low if he really needs what he wants he must take a bus, but the bus contains robbers. 
										This means if Ruhigita takes a bus, and he is visible he will be putting himself in danger. 
										His being on the bus doesn’t mean that he will get robbed but him being in bus visible makes Ruhigita an easy target. <br>
										<br><h3>VPN on public Wi-Fi</h3><br>
										If Ruhigita still want to go to Walmart and he has a cloth that could turn him into invisible that means will not be risking anything because even though Ruhigita is on same 
										bus as the bad people, I mean the robbers they don’t see him what that mean is that he doesn’t exist on their site.
										Just be aware that the cloth that Ruhigita is to protect him only when he is on a bus. What I’m trying to say is that when he gets off the bus and he knows what he is looking for,
										 but he doesn’t know where it is at, he asks for help but everyone else is asking for help too. So Ruhigita will have to leave something to identify him, but he doesn’t want people 
										 who came on same bus to know that he came with them. He will use an identification that came with the cloth that he is wearing. 
										But knowing if Ruhigita needs something that Walmart doesn’t they will have to order it for him but this time his request will not be invisible. 
										It will be visible when Walmart sent his request out, they treated all their customers the same, that is the reason Ruhigita request is treated same as everyone else. <br>

											<p><strong style="font-size: 17px;">Remote Access VPN :</strong> Allow access to a specific network.</p> <br>
											
												In the age of remote work, secure access to company data is paramount. This is where remote
												 access VPNs come in, acting as digital guardians for organizations with geographically dispersed workforces. <br> <br>

												These clever tools create a virtual tunnel, essentially a secure pathway, between a remote user's device and 
												their organization's internal network. Imagine a hidden passageway leading directly from your home office to
												your company's server room – that's the essence of a remote access VPN. The magic lies in encryption. <br>
												As data travels through this virtual tunnel, it's transformed into an unreadable code, a jumble of gibberish 
												to anyone who might try to intercept it. Think of it like sending secret messages in a code only you and your 
												colleagues can understand. Public Wi-Fi networks, often unsecure and teeming with potential eavesdroppers, 
												become a non-issue with a remote access VPN in place. No matter where a remote employee logs in – from a 
												bustling coffee shop to a quiet beachside bungalow – their communication with the company network remains confidential. 
												This secure access unlocks a treasure trove of benefits. Remote workers can seamlessly access all the 
												resources they would have on-site, including critical files, applications, and internal databases. 
												It's like having a virtual extension cord reaching all the way to the office, providing the tools and 
												information needed to be productive no matter the location. <br>

												Collaboration becomes effortless, as colleagues across different time zones can access shared documents 
												and participate in real-time projects with the same level of security as if they were physically present 
												in the office. Remote access VPNs go beyond just convenience; they play a vital role in cybersecurity. 
												By encrypting data, they significantly reduce the risk of sensitive company information falling into the wrong hands. 
												This is especially crucial for organizations that handle confidential data, such as financial institutions or healthcare
												providers. With a remote access VPN in place, companies can empower their workforce to work remotely with peace of mind, 
												knowing that their sensitive data is shielded from prying eyes. <br>

												In essence, remote access VPNs bridge the gap between physical location and secure network access, fostering a world 
												where productivity and security can flourish, even in the age of remote work.
												<br>

												<br>
												<p>
												<p><strong style="font-size: 17px;"> OpenVPN: </strong> A secure and open-source protocol that works across multiple platforms.</p> <br>
												
												How does OpenVPN work. <br> <br>

												
												OpenVPN acts like a digital security guard, creating a secret passage for data to travel between a 
												remote user's device and an organization's network. This tunnel utilizes the well-regarded SSL/TLS 
												protocol to verify identities on both ends, ensuring only authorized users can access the network. 
												Once verified, OpenVPN encrypts all information with strong algorithms, scrambling it into an unreadable code. 
												It then packages this encrypted data with routing information, like labeling a package for secure delivery. 
												The data travels through the internet within this secure tunnel, shielded from anyone trying to intercept it. 
												Finally, upon reaching the organization's server, OpenVPN decrypts the data, allowing it to be delivered to its 
												intended destination within the network. This secure and customizable solution empowers remote users with safe access 
												to company resources, fostering a productive and secure work environment.

										While there are many VPN options available, some cater to specific needs. IPsec offers strong security for business use, 
										but setup might be complex. Mobile VPNs are ideal for smartphones and tablets due to their lightweight design. WireGuard is a newer, 
										faster option gaining popularity, but provider support may vary. SSL VPNs provide convenient web-based access but may have weaker encryption. 
										Finally, personal VPNs are general-purpose services for individual users. Consider your priorities like security, speed,
										and ease of use when choosing a VPN to find the one that best suits you.
